# Public-Healthcare-Database-System
## Using MySQL we created a database for all the medical facilities in Montreal* 
*(all employee and facility information were made up by us to demonstrate the database and GUI). 
### The following UML diagram shows the design of our database.

### The entire database is in Boyce-Codd Normal Form to minimize redundency and to optimize the database for fastest search and querying. 

## Database Features:
### - health tracking system: any employee that has been infected with COVID or any other virus will be input in the system and their coworkers will be notified by email. The infected employee cannot be scheduled for the following two weeks.
### - automatic employee scheduling: every week employees are scheduled for their shifts--infections and previous work schedules are taken into account
